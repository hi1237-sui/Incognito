## Deployment

- Incognito is the easiest proxy to deploy!
- Currently, there are 3 ways to deploy Incognito
    - [Pre-built binaries](#Pre-built-binaries)
    - [Docker]()
    - [Building and running yourself]()

#### Pre-built Binaries

- When a new version is pushed, our CI automagically builds & uploads pre-built binaries to the release.
- This enables you to: 
    - A. Not install any extra runtime or install any new packages
    - B. Updates are easy and quick. Just download the new binary!

###### Usage:

- First grab the current binary for your system & OS [here](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/incognito/releases/latest)
- Then simply run the binary!
    - For example using linux:
    ```bash
    ./incognito-linux --server full
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - You MAY have to make the binary executable on certain systems.
>    - For example in Linux:
>    ```bash
>    chmod +x ./incognito-linux
>    ```
>
> - To see all of the CLI options & usage see: [cli](#cli)

#### Docker

- Docker is the second easiest way to run Incognito.
- Currently, Docker images are built by [@motortruck1221](https://github.com/motortruck1221) manually per version update.
    - They can be located here: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/motortruck1221/incognito](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/motortruck1221/incognito)
- This enables:
    - Automatic updates
    - Easier deployment then building yourself.
    - No dependencies besides docker w/compose

###### Usage:

- The Docker builds currently have 2 tags:
    - Latest
    - Or a pinned version of the build (eg: 1.1.7)
- Currently, only Docker compose is supported. Docker without compose *can be used* but it's highly discouraged.

- Prerequisites:
    - Docker w/compose

- First, create a `config.toml` file and copy the [example config from the repo](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/incognito/blob/main/config.example.toml)
- Then, copy and paste the contents of the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/incognito/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) into your own docker-compose.yml file
- After that, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to your liking.
- And finally:
```bash
docker compose up
```
- That should fire Incognito up and you should be good!

> [!NOTE]
> - To see all of the CLI options & usage see: [cli](#cli)
>
> - To see all of the `config.toml` options see: [config](#config)

#### Building & Running yourself

- This is the last way to run Incognito

###### Usage:

- Prerequisites:
    - Git
    - Deno 2.1.4 or newer
    - Node.js & NPM

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/incognito.git
```

2. Install all of the dependencies:
```bash
deno install --allow-scripts # This flag is here due to sharp, bufferutil and some others
```

3. Create a `config.toml` file
```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

4. Modify the `config.toml` file to your liking. See: [config](#config)

5. Build the frontend
```bash
deno task build
```

6. Start the server
```bash
deno task start --server full
```

> [!NOTE]
> - To see all of the CLI options & usage see: [cli](#cli)

---

## CLI

- Incognito has a built in CLI for starting and running
- Currently, there are only 4 flags.

- `--help` - This triggers the help prompt even when other flags are passed.
- `--server [full|standalone]` - Choose between the full or standalone server. This option is ***required*** otherwise, it will just show the help prompt.
    - Full - Uses Fastify has a built in Wisp server (via [wisp server node](https://github.com/mercuryworkshop/wisp-server-node)) *(recommended for self hosters)*
    - Standalone - Uses Hono as the server with no built in Wisp server. *(recommended for a huge production instance with an external wisp server)*
    - These are the only two options. Anything else passed here WILL throw an error.
- `--config <config path>` - Use a config located somewhere else.
    - Useful when using the [Pre-built binaries](#pre-built-binaries)
    - The path can either be absolute or relative.
- `--seo` - Currently the default is to only use the build with no seo enabled. This flag enables the seo build.
    - Domain must be set in the [config](#config)
    - Overrides the enabled option in the [config](#config)
